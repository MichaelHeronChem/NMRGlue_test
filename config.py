# --- General ---

SOLVENT_PPM = 1.94  # Acetonitrile (CD3CN) standard chemical shift

# --- Phasing Mode ---
# Select the phasing strategy:
# 'manual'        -> Uses P0, P1, and PIVOT_PPM
# 'acme'          -> Auto-phasing using the ACME algorithm
# 'peak_minima'   -> Auto-phasing using minima-minimisation around highest peak
# 'edge_symmetry' -> Auto-phasing by minimizing asymmetry of all peak edges
# 'edge_anchor'   -> Optimizes P0 on a specific anchor peak, then optimizes P1 globally

# --- Edge Anchor / Symmetry Parameters ---
ANCHOR_PPM = 11.0  # The target ppm for the anchor peak (used in 'edge_anchor')

# --- Auto-Phasing & Auto-Baseline Exclusion Zone ---
# Ignores the massive solvent/water peaks between these values.

# Normalizing to the maximum peak makes visual comparison
# between Amine, Aldehyde, and Reaction much easier.

# --- Plot X-Axis Limits ---
# Set to True to automatically fit the x-axis to the exact bounds of the acquired data.
# Set to False to enforce the fixed standard limits below.
